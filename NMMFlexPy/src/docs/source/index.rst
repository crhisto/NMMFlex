Welcome to NMMFlex's documentation!
===================================

Introducing NMMFlex, a Python package that enhances and extends the functionality of the Non-negative Multiple Matrix Factorization (NMMF) algorithm. This innovative solution, originally proposed by `Takeuchi et al. (2013) <https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/13/Papers/254.pdf>`_, has been refined and adapted through our package to maximize its potential. NMMFlex offers an advanced implementation, bringing significant improvements and bespoke modifications to the core NMMF algorithm.
